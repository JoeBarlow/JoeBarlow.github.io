        <p style="font-size: 1.5em; text-align: justify">
            Treasure island is a second year university project featuring local multiplayer.
            Players use gamepads to control their ships and collect coins to bank at base.
            To disrupt other players you can bump them or use items causing them to drop coins and spin out of control.

                <h2>Local Multiplayer:</h2>
                <p>
                    To set up local multiplayer I made use of Unity’s input system.
                    This system allowed me to create different action maps for the main menu and gameplay and switch between them seamlessly.<br /><br />
                    For example, the action map for the main menu featured controls such as: UI movement and Interact.
                    Whereas, the gameplay action map would include: movement, aim, and use item.
                    By using these actions with a player input component, every time an input is detected a function of the same name would be called on the attached C# script.
                    E.g. the ‘Interact’ action would call the ‘OnInteract’ function.<br /><br />
                    Treasure Island supports up to 4 players, each map has 4 relevant towers where a player can bank their coins.
                    In the case where less than 4 players have joined, the remaining towers are disabled and feature as a decorative piece.

                <p style="margin-top: 0;">
                    At the time of development this input system was a new addition to Unity and I wanted to learn how it works and whether it was better than the old system.
                    It was easy to set up and allowed me to prototype the game very quickly.

                <h2>Combat and Items:</h2>
                <p>
                    The most basic mechanic in player combat was the bump, put simply crashing into another player spins them out.
                    To detect who was the attacker and who was the target, I used a combination of collision detection and raycasts.
                    Two rays were positioned facing outwards on the front of each boat, therefore if both the collision object and raycast object match the current ship is the bumper.<br /><br />
                    The attacker then calls a function on the target, transferring force in the forward direction of the attacker.
                    This meant even a head-on collision would result in both ships being sent backwards - which is a nice touch.
                    To account for multiple ships crashing into one target, I delayed the force application until the end of the frame and calculated the cross product of all contributing forces.<br /><br />
                    Alongside this, I added a slip stream feature to allow ships to catch up with a player they are closely following.
                    Finally, to add the finishing touches to combat I implemented a cannonball projectile and whirlwind speed boost, to boost diversity in player confrontation.

                <p style="margin-top: 0;">
                    I wanted to make sure that basic combat was fun and engaging - making items feel like an extension of the combat not the foundation.

                <h2>Colour Selecting:</h2>
                <p>
                    The idea behind selecting colour was to allow the player to customise the appearance of their ship’s sails and tower.
                    There are 6 colours to choose from and only 1 player can hold a colour at any given time.<br /><br />
                    The selection menu conveys which colour the user is hovering over by making the icon darker.
                    This functionality affects each player independently as each person may be hovering over a different colour.
                    Pressing the ‘A’ button on a colour will lock it in for that player, this results in the colour being removed from the available list and faded out for every other selection menu.<br /><br />
                    To actually apply the colour, I swap out the active material on the ship’s sail with a preset material to match the chosen colour.
                    I also update the little flags above each player’s tower as well as the particle system demonstrating the base area.
                </p>

            <div class="seperation_line"><h3>Why This Approach?</h3></div>

                <p style="margin-top: 0;">
                    I believe colour selecting adds more personality to the game and gets players more invested as they choose a design that best represents them.
                    I also think it helps identify people in your friend group easier, as you made an intentional decision on who was who.

        <h3 style="font-size: 1.5em;">What I Learned</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 1.5em; text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 5%">
            Despite there not being as much content, I had a lot of fun developing and playing Treasure Island as it was always being made with multiplayer in mind.
            I found that playing Treasure Island with friends was naturally more fun simply because it was experienced with more people.<br /><br />
            The game timer of 5 minutes feels too long in retrospect.
            As nothing changes throughout the game whether that be items or map design, it quickly feels stale around the 3 minute mark.
            However, map design is not simple and intelligent layouts are required to make an interesting and natural gameplay loop.
            This is especially true for multiplayer games that take place on 1 screen as there is a much smaller space to work with.
