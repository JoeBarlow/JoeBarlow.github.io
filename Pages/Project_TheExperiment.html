            The Experiment is a mobile game developed by myself for a final year university project.
            The Experiment features 3 unique abilities and 16 playable levels, in order to survive the cell must collect its abilities and solve puzzles to continue its climb.

                <h2>Touch Controls:</h2>
                <p>
                    The idea behind movement was to use touch controls to "fling" the cell in the opposite direction to where the player dragged.
                    This was supposed to resemble a slingshot-type movement accompanied by a directional arrow.<br /><br />
                    The arrow pointer grows outward from the cell to display the direction and power before the player releases the touch.
                    It does this by subtracting the current position of the player's finger from the starting position, and rotating and scaling the arrow to match.
                    However, this implementation quickly became confusing as the player would lose track of where they started the movement from.
                    Therefore, to supplement the arrow I included a "shadow pointer" which draws a line between the starting and current position of the touch-drag.<br /><br />
                    Other abilities and interactions were also controlled by touch but were context sensitive. For example, the "spike" ability could only be activated whilst the cell was in the air.

                    With touch controls implemented this way, the player can control the character from any point of the screen.
                    I find this flexibility desirable as the touch-drag can be performed wherever the user pleases and caters to people with varying devices, hand sizes, and grip.

                <h2>Spike, Resize, Divide:</h2>
                <p>
                    The spike mechanic has a simple concept, it allows the cell to stick to certain walls.
                    It does this by extending the circle collider of the cell to better match its new form, then waits for a collision with a "wall" object.
                    If the cell then touches a wall all velocity is removed and gravity is disabled for as long as the interaction is held.<br /><br />
                    The resize mechanic has one purpose: increase the mass of the cell.
                    Doing this allows the player to build up more force when falling and destroy cracked floor.
                    It also resists the force of the fans which allows the player to control their impact.
                    Size is controlled by pinching the screen and zooming in and out.<br /><br />
                    The divide mechanic splits the cell into two when the divide wall is hit.
                    Doing so will reduce the cell's maximum growth size but allows the player to control both cells at once.
                    Each cell can be controlled by interacting with its relevant side of the screen, whether it be horizontal or vertical.

                    Although very simple, these mechanics provide a lot of flexibility in level design and can build on each other to provide complexity.
                    The controls closely resemble standard phone inputs to make them more intuitive.

                <h2>Boss Battle:</h2>
                <p>
                    The boss battle in The Experiment takes place on the highest level which turns out to be the top of a bottle.
                    The cell must repeatedly strike the cork in the top of the bottle to remove it and earn freedom.<br /><br />
                    However, to climb high enough the player must use the spike ability to stick to falling walls and avoid the sharp edges on the bottom.
                    The walls are spawned randomly between 3 points in the left, middle, and right.
                    This creates lanes of danger and safety, encouraging the player to plan ahead.<br /><br />
                    The final mechanic starts once the boss' health is below 50%.
                    The room is divided into 2 and falling spikes are dropped on the player's side.
                    To avoid being squashed the player must quickly hit the divide wall in the centre, discarding the previous cell and evading death.

                    Thematically, I liked the reveal that "The Experiment" was trying to escape its test bottle this whole time.
                    The boss battle being in a slightly different format than the usual upward climb is also a nice change of pace, and shows how versatile the mechanics are.

        <h3 style="font-size: 1.5em;">What I Learned</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 1.5em; text-align: justify; padding-bottom: 5%">
            As I was the sole developer on this project I play-tested the game a lot.
            After getting quite good my perspective of what made a level difficult was skewed.
            I believe the early game of "The Experiment" is far too difficult and mechanics are introduced a lot earlier than needed.
            If I were to rework these levels I would take my time and allow the difficulty to progress gradually.
            Level one should really be no more than a couple of jumps - difficulty aside it's also important to be introduced to a reward loop as soon as possible.<br /><br />
            Another more simple lesson is to consider how a mobile game will scale with the varying screen size and aspect ratio of different devices.
            Especially if the walls are supposed to be the border of the screen.
